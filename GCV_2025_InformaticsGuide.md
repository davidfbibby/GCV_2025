## **To run the software you will have to activate an environment (bioinfo_env), What is an Environment?**
An environment is an isolated space where specific software, dependencies, and libraries are installed. It ensures that all required tools run in a controlled and reproducible way, avoiding conflicts with other system applications.

## For this course, we use the **bioinfo_env** environment.

⚠️ **Note:** Software will **not work outside the environment.**

---

## **How to Activate the bioinfo_env Environment**
Before using any software, activate the environment with:

```bash
conda activate bioinfo_env
```

## **To deactivate the environment when you're done:**

```bash
conda deactivate
```

## Informatics Set-Up
We are currently using Oracle VM Virtual Box (https://www.virtualbox.org/) to deliver Informatics, you can find Virtual Box Guides below:
[Virtual Machine SetUp Guide for Intel-Mac and Windows](https://github.com/WCSCourses/index/blob/main/VM%20Guide.pdf). <br />

The Host OS Requirements for Virtual Box <br />
- RAM requirement: 8GB (preferably 12GB) <br />
- Processor requirement: 4 processors (preferably 8) <br />
- Hard disk space: 200GB <br />
- Admin rights to the computer <br />

Note: Please be aware that Virtual Box is currently incompatible with M1/M2/M3 chips on MacBook.
It is exclusively designed for use on Intel-based MacBooks. The current version in use is Virtual Box 7.0.
